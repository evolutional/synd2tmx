Syndicate Map extractor to TMX file format

Very old and hacky code from 2012 that was used to extract an unpacked set of syndicate data files to images and data that can be used with the tiled map editor.

This was never intended to be released as it's terrible, prototype and hacky :)


This code was converted from the notes in https://icculus.org/libsyndicate/libsyndicate.pdf to C#

You'll have to unpack and your own game data files.
